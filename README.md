This application, called shinyView, is the result of a study entitled 'Practical Guide for Developing Shiny Applications for Image Visualization'. 
The didactic images used to create this application stem from previous modeling conducted in the academic paper entitled 'Climate Projections and the Future of Invasive Plant Species in the Caatinga'. The guide aims to present a simplified methodology for individuals interested in creating Shiny applications for image visualization, or incorporating image visualization as part of a larger application. 
shinyView exemplifies the final result that these individuals can achieve. As for the content displayed in this application, it shows the distribution of species in the Caatinga ecosystem, located in Northeast Brazil. 
In previous studies, we used georeferenced data from 19 non-native species, along with temperature and precipitation information, to generate figures and assess the distribution of these species until the end of the 21st century in response to climate change.
